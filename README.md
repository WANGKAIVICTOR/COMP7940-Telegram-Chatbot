# Telegram-Chatbot

## Description
This is a group prject of COMP7940 Cloud Computing in 2022-2023 semester 2. We use telegram chatbot to implement various functions and set permissions so that only users who use activation codes shared by administrators can access these functions. We used the cloud SQL server provided by Tencent Cloud and Docker to deploy the project to Azure.
